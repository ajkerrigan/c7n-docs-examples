     Checks existing VPC Peering Connections to see if the Accepter
     and Requester account numbers are both internally owned accounts.
     If a connection is going to/from an external AWS account then the
     cloud and security teams are notified of the violating peering connection.

        violation_desc: |
            VPC Peers are not to be setup to or from external AWS accounts
            so this policy verifies that both the source and destination
            accounts are internally owned. If the peering connection is going
            to/from an external account, this policy will email the Cloud and
            Security Teams as well as the customer.

            Please investigate this VPC Peering connection and terminate it
