        violation_desc: |
            VPC Peers are not to be setup to or from external AWS accounts
            so this policy verifies that both the source and destination
            accounts are internally owned. If the peering connection is going
            to/from an external account, this policy will email the Cloud and
            Security Teams as well as the customer.
        action_desc: |
            Please investigate this VPC Peering connection and terminate it
            if it's connecting to a unapproved external VPC
